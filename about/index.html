          <p>We are a distinct and highly diverse group of seasoned and accomplished entrepreneurs. With our deep understanding and appreciation for building businesses, we are an ideal partner for early-stage tech-based startup companies that are growing and scaling. As “Game Changers” and disruptors, we are more than traditional investors, we look deeper, wider, and bigger in all opportunities.</p>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <p>Unlike many investment groups that are chasing the next “Unicorns,” we like to get involved on the ground floor. We are a business-oriented group and have a tolerance for high-risks. We know how to find great drivers and are willing to put our experience, expertise, and capital to work.</p>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <p>We are not looking to invest in cars, we are looking to invest in drivers. We encourage and support confident, aggressive, and open-minded entrepreneurs with endless energy and passion for success.</p>
          <p>City Side Ventures and their managing partners and employees are committed in making the Michigan startup ecosystem stronger and better.</p>
