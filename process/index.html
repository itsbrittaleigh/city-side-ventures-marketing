        <p class="lead"><em>Our philosophy is simple.</em></p>
        <p>If you put a great driver in an average car, you will get above average performance. A great driver will perform with any car, at any time, in any race.</p>

        <p>We can fix or suit up the car. We are not "Industry" focused we are "Driver" focused. Find the driver, fix him a car, and get him in the race.</p>
