          <p><strong>How Does CSV Use Registration Information?</strong></p>
          <p>
            CSV’s registration forms may require users to give us contact information (like their
            name and e-mail address) and demographic information (like their ZIP code, age, or
            income level). We use this information from the registration form to send our users
            information about our program offering and special invitations such as network events,
            conferences etc. The user’s contact information is also used to contact the user when
            necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out
            section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected during registration.
            We use this data to tailor the user’s experience at www.citysideventures.com showing
            people content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content
            according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an
            aggregate basis. Further, information submitted as part of your application may be
            visible to registered users on the site, especially as it concerns information about
            your company, and the pitch you are presenting.
