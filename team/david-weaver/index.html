  Mr. Weaver most recently was CEO of <a href="http://www.blazemedicaldevices.com" target="_blank">Blaze Medical Devices, LLC</a> an early stage medical device company. Blaze will offer the first standardized and commercial device that can be used to measure sub-hemolytic damage of red blood cells.  This is important to the medical industry for better quality control and the transfusion market for measuring the quality of donated blood in storage awaiting transfusion was achieved.  Currently there is no objective metric for knowing the quality of blood prior to transfusion and consequently there are many adverse events. Mr. Weaver, moved Blaze from “concept” to achieving “proof of concept” and a working prototype, secured 4 issued patents, 2 NIH Grants and $1.3 M in angel funding in a billion-dollar undeserved market.  Set up conversations with a number of potential acquiring companies to follow Blaze.
